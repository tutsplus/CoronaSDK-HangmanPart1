### Tuts+ Tutorial: Create a Dancing Hangman Game in Corona: Project Setup

#### Instructor: James Tyner

In this two-part series, I will be showing you how to create the classic game of hangman. This version comes with a surprise ending, however. If you win the game the hangman does a happy dance. Along the way, you will learn about Corona's drawing API, scene management, dispatching custom events, how to utilize a sprite sheet, and how to use modules to emulate classes in the Lua programming language.
